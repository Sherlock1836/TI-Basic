# TI-Basic Programs
This repo contains programs I wrote in TI-Basic in highschool for the TI-84 Plus CE. They were made specifically for the Plus CE edition but could be edited to run on the regular 84 or 83.
To run these programs download the .8xp files then use [TI-Connect CE](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware) software to transfer the program to the calculator. You can then access them from the program menu on the calculator.

Zoom
* Zoom is a game I made in which you use the arrow keys to navigate a ship (^ character) through portals (0s) in order to avoid obstacles. It features 3 levels of difficulty as well as a highscore tracker (uses custom list to keep track of highest 3 scores for each level).

Euler's Method Problem Solver
* Euler is a program I made to solve Euler's Method problems in AP Calculus BC, and I was able to use it on the exam which was lit. Should be pretty intuitive to use.

Binary Converter
* Binary is a program that converts binary to decimal and vice versa. It features a cool UI (or at least I think so), and is able to handle relatively large numbers. Comes in handy for classes that you have tedious binary conversion homework for. It's pretty cool how the algorithm works too.
