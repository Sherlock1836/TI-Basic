# TI-Basic Programs
This repo contains programs I wrote in TI-Basic in highschool for the TI-84 Plus CE. They were made specifically for the Plus CE edition but could be edited to run on the regular 84 or 83.
To run these programs download the .8xp files then use TI-Connect CE software to transfer the program to the calculator. You can then access them from the program menu on the calculator.
